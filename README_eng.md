Perfect Script for Farming Management.

## Modules:

1. **evm_balance_checker**: Quickly (asynchronously) checks the balance of any token on any EVM network.
2. **starknet_balance_checker**: Quickly (asynchronously) checks the balance of tokens on Starknet network.
3. **debank_checker**: Swiftly (asynchronously) inspects tokens, NFTs, and protocols across multiple EVM networks (available on [DeBank](https://debank.com/)).
4. **exchange_withdraw**: Withdraws assets from exchanges like Binance, MEXC, KuCoin, Bybit, Huobi, Bitget, CoinEx.
5. **[okx_withdraw](https://www.okx.com/)**: Withdraws assets from the OKX exchange, including sub-account withdrawals (handled as a separate module due to sub-account functionality).
6. **transfer**: Transfers assets from wallets to EVM networks.
7. **0x_swap**: Utilizes an aggregator as an alternative to 1inch for token swaps.
8. **[orbiter](https://www.orbiter.finance/)**: Bridges Ethereum assets to various networks, including ZKSync Era and StarkNet. To bridge to StarkNet, add StarkNet wallet addresses to the `starknet_address.txt` file.
9. **[woofi_bridge](https://fi.woo.org/)**: Bridges assets using the WooFi bridge via Stargate (LayerZero), supporting a wide range of tokens and networks.
10. **[woofi_swap](https://fi.woo.org/)**: Swaps tokens using the WooFi swap feature, which is versatile and supports numerous tokens and networks.
11. **[sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/swap)**: Executes swaps on SushiSwap, accessible on major networks except for Optimism (currently).
12. **[bungee_refuel](https://www.bungee.exchange/refuel)**: Cost-effective bridge for transferring native tokens between networks.
13. **tx_checker**: Monitors nonces across nearly all EVM networks.
14. **[1inch_swap](https://app.1inch.io/)**: Leverages the 1inch aggregator for token swaps.
15. **[zerius_refuel](https://zerius.io/)**: Transfers gas from one network to another via LayerZero.
16. **nft_checker**: Swiftly (asynchronously) checks the balance of specific NFTs.
17. **[zerius_onft](https://zerius.io/)**: Mint and bridge nft via layerzero; ideal for warming up networks.
18. **[starkgate_bridge](https://starkgate.starknet.io/)**: Bridge from Ethereum to Starknet. 
19. **[base_bridge](https://bridge.base.org/deposit)**: Bridge from Ethereum to Base.
20. **[arbitrum_bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)**: Bridge from Ethereum to Arbitrum One / Arbitrum Nova.
21. **[zora_bridge](https://bridge.zora.energy/)**: Bridge from Ethereum to Zora.
22. **[zksync_bridge](https://portal.txsync.io/bridge/)**: Bridge from Ethereum to ZkSync.

## Additional Information:

- All results are duplicated to the terminal and a Telegram bot.
- **evm_balance_checker** and **nft_checker** use multicall to speed up tracking.
- The ability to enable proxies in web3. It works as follows: it takes all your wallets and sequentially uses proxies from the `proxies.txt` file. Thus, the distribution of proxies will be even. The number of wallets and proxies may differ. For example, if there are 10 wallets and 3 proxies, the distribution will be: proxy_1 = 4 wallets, proxy_2 = 3 wallets, proxy_3 = 3 wallets.
- A maximum gas fee is set for each network. If the gas cost exceeds the set limit, the script will wait for the price to decrease (`setting.py => MAX_GAS_CHARGE`).
- Transactions that remain in pending status for more than the set time (`config.py => max_time_check_tx_status`) are automatically considered completed to avoid delays, especially in the BSC network.
- Modules can be run individually or in groups through `tracks.py`.
- Asynchrony: support for simultaneous running of multiple wallets.

# Configuration

To configure the script:

1. Adjust settings in the `setting.py` file, following the descriptions within. You need to rename `setting_EXAMPLE.py` to `setting.py`
2. If you plan to run multiple modules sequentially, configure them in the `tracks.py` file.
3. Rename the `datas_EXAMPLE` folder to `datas`.
4. Within the `datas` folder, you'll find five files:
   - `wallets.txt`: Add wallets (private keys/addresses) here.
   - `recipients.txt`: Add recipient addresses for transfers, used in the transfer module when transferring from a wallet to an address. One wallet corresponds to one address.
   - `proxies.txt`: Add proxies for use in the debank checker. They are also used in web3 if `USE_PROXY = True` (in the config). The format is: `http://login:password@ip:port`.
   - `starknet_address.txt`: Add StarkNet wallet addresses here. Skip this step if you're not bridging from Orbiter to StarkNet.
   - `data.py`: Contains all the private information, such as RPC, tg_token, tg_id, API keys for exchanges.
5. Configure the modules in the `value` classes in the `setting.py` file.
6. Execute the `main.py` file. If `USE_TRACKS = False`, a list of modules will appear in the terminal, and you can select one.

# Using Tracks (Running Multiple Modules)

To enable track mode:

1. Set `USE_TRACKS = True` in `setting.py`.
2. In `tracks.py`, configure tracks with modules. You can create multiple tracks and select them in `setting.py` using the `TRACK` variable.
3. The `wait_balance` function works only in track mode: Select a network where you want to wait for a coin and set the minimum balance. When the coin's balance exceeds `min_balance`, the script advances to the next module, with balance checks every 10 seconds.

# Installation

Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
